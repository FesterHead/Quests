# NOTICE - 2020-12-01
I am taking a break from Spigot-based Minecraft and playing single-player Forge centered around MineColonies.

## About Quests
This plugin is a fork from:
- https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/23696/ 
- https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests/               
                                                     
Modifications permitted via MIT License             

I use it for my BentoBox SkyBlock server.

## Credit
- All credit goes to [LMBishop](https://github.com/LMBishop).
- I tried other quest plugins and they were either too complex or were missing tasks I wanted to use for my SkyBlock server.
- The combination of the BentoBox level, permissions, and PlaceholderAPI tasks was the hook.
- Being able to fork the repository and add in a crafting task was the ultimate win.
