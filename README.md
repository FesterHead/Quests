## Credit
- All credit goes to [LMBishop](https://github.com/LMBishop).
- I tried other quest plugins and they were either too complex or were missing pieces I really want to use for my SkyBlock server.
- The combination of the BentoBox level, permissions, and PlaceholderAPI tasks was the hook.
- Being able to add in a crafting task was the ultimate win.
